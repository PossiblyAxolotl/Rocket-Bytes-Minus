# Rocket Bytes Minus
### a super stripped-down version of Rocket Bytes

I'll be honest a lot of this code is.. interesting.. which is what happens when you make a game while just learning to use the engine but here it is, in a fully stripped-down but playable form.

This is more for you to adapt and use for your own projects, especially the particle system

If you want a good playable version with a full OST and a level editor head over to https://possiblyaxolotl.itch.io/rocketbytes

### Don't expect this to be updated a lot
it won't.

also if you want watch the devlog on how I made my game https://youtu.be/VpttrgtQsmQ

bye!
